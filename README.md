# Student-Helper
## Description
This project is an educational app to aid students with their studies by providing 3 primary features: flashcards, reminders and a fun math game based on the UK show 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown. With these features, the goal is for students to become more interested and on-top of their studies by keeping them informed of due dates, providing them with great study tool and rewards through the use of the Countdown game. 

I created Student Helper during my first semester of my second year at James Cook University (JCU) where we had to create an educational app solely meant for helping students.

## Development and Timeframe
This app is solely meant for Android devices as it was built in Android Studio. All saved data from the user is stored locally on the device. 

As JCU only wanted an educational app for Android, I followed their requirements for the app and fulfilled every request. However, if I were to assign more time to this project, I would like to implement the below additions and modifications to the app: 
1. Make the app cross-platform, preferrably with React Native or Flutter.
2. Utilise a cloud-database provider (AWS, Firebase, etc.) for login and user-data to allow users to login to any device and resume their progress.
3. Improve the design. 

This app took me roughly 2 months to make. In this time, I researched common problems among students, planned, designed, created a Figma prototype, created the coded-prototype and resolved all errors and warnings. 

## Features
Each primary feature consists of many sub-features that improve the use and conveniency of each primary function. 
### Flashcards
- Users can add, modify and delete saved flashcards.
- By shaking the device, the answer to the current flashcard is revealed.

### Reminders 
- Users can add, modify and delete saved reminders.
- Each reminder shows the task, the class/area the reminder is associated with and the time left until the reminder's due date. 
- Reminders are devided into two groups based on their severity-level: high-priority and other. High-priority is for reminders that are overdue, due on the day or are manually assigned by the user. Other applies to all other reminders.
- Users can change the severity-level of each reminder by clicking on the reminder.
- Users can delete a reminder by pressing and holding onto the reminder.

### Countdown Game
- Users try to reach the generated number by using the basic mathematical operators (+, -, /, *) with any or all of the 6 given numbers.
- Users apply two numbers together by clicking on both numbers separately. The first number goes empty and disables itself after it's been used.
- Users are rewarded with points if they match the required number. Number of points are based on difficulty and time left. 
- Users can reset their working and all 6 numbers if they make a mistake.
- Users can view the step-by-step solution of how the app generated the target number.

### Additional Features
Addditional features are available in the app and they include: 
- Send a tweet to Twitter that contains their current progress among all 3 primary features. There is a default for the tweet but it is customisable.
- User can change the time and difficulty for the Countdown game.
- Change their display name in the default tweet from the Settings page.
- Reset their progress on one or all primary features. 

## How to run
1. Open the app with Android Studio.
2. Run the app using the Android Emulator.
